And this is an actual comment on this implementation.

- independant from openerp
- lightweight solution
- using jquery
- provided javascript ``main.js`` is 126 lines long.
- provided HTML ``index.html`` is 17 lines long.


Note: provided implementation of ``rpc_jsonp`` and ``json`` functions is greatly
inspired by openerp implementation.

If you want to make this implementation work, you'll have to change hard written values
in ``main.js`` in the ``login`` function.
